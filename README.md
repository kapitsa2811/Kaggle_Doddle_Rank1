# Kaggle_Doddle_Rank1
### Reproduce my processes: see the image "training processes"
let me upload my checkpoint in Google Drive & 百度云, may be you can finetune the model by adding more data for seresnext50 model

In split_data, if you didn't change the random seed, our validation set should be same. Just in case, I will also upload my validation set. You can confirm if they are same. Or, you can input my checkpoint and continue to train (just for test), the first iter should show ~0.887
